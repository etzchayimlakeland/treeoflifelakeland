			 <p class="mb-2">I want to personally invite you to visit our congregation to experience the richness of Messianic Judaism. Messianic Judaism is not a new phenomenon; it began 2,000 years ago by Yeshua (Jesus), the promised Messiah of Israel. Enamored by this newly found faith, His talmidim (disciples) took this profound gift of redemption and shared it with all the other nations. Now, as Jews and non-Jews worshipping together, we can truly experience what Ephesians 2:14 says: “For He Himself is our shalom (peace), Who has made the two one.” It is in this unity, that we can see the power of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob manifest to miraculously touch the lives of those who trust in Him.</p>
